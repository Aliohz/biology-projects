# Introduction to Programming in Biology

These are the projects I worked on for this course. They are built in R and the reports were written in R Markdown.

The first is "Isotopic enrichment". In this project we tested the enrichment of δ13C and δ15N in the trophic chain. The second project is "Candidate cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication sites in the human genome", using the poisson process we recommend certain sites within the
human genome
