# Introduction to Programming in Biology

These are the projects I worked on for this course. They are built in R and the reports were written in R Markdown.

## Contents:
- "Isotopic enrichment". In this project we tested the enrichment of δ13C and δ15N in the trophic chain.
- "Candidate cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication sites in the human genome". Using the poisson process we recommend certain sites within the human genome as there are higher amount of palindromes than expected under a gamma distribution.
- "Lateral dispersal of aquatic insects". With bayesian inference, we used a mixed effects model with a exponential function to explore which family of Trichoptera has higher and lower dispersion from the stream.
- "Reproductive isolation by distance". We found correlation between genetic and geografic distance in *Charadrius nivosus* populations using linear regression and a Mantel test.

## How to see the reports
Navigate to the different folders of each project and look for the ".md" file. It contains the rendered code :D
